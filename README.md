## AirWare
AirWare enables citizens to monitor air quality in their immediate surroundings as well as in their city

AirWear enables a whole new level of distributed air quality monitoring, created using data aggregated from non-localized nodes. As you go through your day, AirWear automatically records metrics about the air you were breathing. Spikes in air quality can create automated alerts, which will immediately let you know that you are breathing polluted air. AirWear will recommend clean routes for your commutes, and provide real-time pollution “heatmaps” of your community and city.
